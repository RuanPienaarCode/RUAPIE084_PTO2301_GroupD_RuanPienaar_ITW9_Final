#Styling Outcomes:
#Make use of Flexbox styles:
○ with any containers or content where containing elements are not flowing well
with the content inside of them,
○ where content is being cut off,
○ wherever you see it fit to implement,
○ where it may improve the responsiveness of content on your site.
#Implement CSS Grid styles:
○ on any sort of content that uses fixed layouts that are unresponsive/use too
many media queries.
There may be instances where either the application of CSS Grid and Flexbox may be a
solution to your project. It is up to you, as the developer, to decide which is the best
solution to use. Examples of where either could be applicable are: navbar, cards, list
items, image containers and tables. PLEASE NOTE: You will need to explain your
reasoning for the decision in your final live presentation.
Make effective use of HTML components such as: navbars, page hero, cards, buttons,
icons, etc to improve a users experience when navigating your site.
#Ensure that your website has:
○ good device responsiveness,
○ makes use of different fonts and colours that contrast well, and
○ makes use of good layout and structuring tools such as Box Model, Flexbox or
CSS Grid, etc.
